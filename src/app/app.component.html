      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>We would like you to make a small application which calls three of our APIs found on <a target="_blank"
          href="https://developer.parliament.uk/">developer.parliament.uk</a> </p>
      <P>The three APIs we are going to be asking you to call are:</P>
      <ul>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://members-api.parliament.uk/index.html">Members API</a>- this API supplies
          Member data (both
          Commons and Lords)</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://members-api.parliament.uk/index.html">Commons votes</a>- this API supplies
          vote data for
          Commons</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://members-api.parliament.uk/index.html">Lords votes</a> - this API supplies
          vote data for
          Lords</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The task is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Replace these instructions with a series of components that do the following</li>
        <li>Call the Members API and show a paged list of Members</li>
        <li>
          Add a filter at the top of the list which enables a user to filter Members based on their name and/or House
        </li>
        <li>Show details about Members on cards</li>
        <li>You can use similar styling to <a target="_blank" href="https://members.parliament.uk/members/Commons">our
            styling</a> - but please do not just copy it. We want to see how you might present this data</li>
        <li>If a user clicks on a Member card then use the Votes APIs to show the last 3 votes the Member
          participated in, and show some relevant details
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr>      
      <h3>Members API</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You can search Members using our search endpoint - /api/Members/Search

        </li>
        <li>This has a Name and House parameter</li>
        <li>When you receive data about a Member you can determine what House they sit in with the property
          "member.latestHouseMembership.house" 1 for Commons and 2 for Lords
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Votes APIs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The contracts for Commons and Lords votes are the same, but they have separate endpoints</li>
        <li>If a Member has House 1 then you need to use the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://commonsvotes-api.parliament.uk/">Commons
            API</a>
        </li>
        <li>If a Member has House 2 then you need to use the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://lordsvotes-api.parliament.uk/index.html">Lords API</a>
        </li>
        <li>Please investigate the votes contracts to determine the best endpoint to call</li>              
      </ul>
